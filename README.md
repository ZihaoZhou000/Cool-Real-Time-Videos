# Cool-Real-Time-Videos

The goal for this project is to make a simple GUI that can add some widget on your face and replace the background of the real-time video. 
Users can press ‘g’ on their keyboard to start or stop wearing sunglasses, press ‘r’ to start or stop replacing the background into beach, and press ‘q’ to quit.
The effect should look as if you are wearing sunglasses on a beach, although you are just sitting at home recording a video or having an online meeting!
